For investigations based on microscopic model systems one has to devise strategies to deal with the curse of dimensionality inherent to the quantum many-body problem. Particularly challenging is the development of efficient and versatile computational methods that serve as crucial link between experimental observations and theoretical models. For this purpose, we employ machine learning methods, which are for example well suited to represent the many-body wave function in a compressed form.</p><p>Our group is based at the
<a href=https://www.uni-regensburg.de/en target=_blank>University of Regensburg</a> and furthermore affiliated with
<a href=https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/pgi/pgi-8 target=_blank>PGI-8 at Forschungszentrum Jülich</a>.</p><h3 id=your-job>Your job</h3><p>A central objective of our work is the advancement of numerical simulation techniques based on
<a href=/research/neural_quantum_states/>neural quantum states</a>. The underlying idea of this approach is to tackle the quantum curse of dimensionality by exploiting the proven merit of artificial neural networks for dealing with high-dimensional data. This new numerically exact technique can overcome existing limitations of established computational methods. Thereby, it opens up new areas for numerical investigations, which are at the same time brought into focus by recent developments in quantum simulation – for example with Rydberg atom arrays.
