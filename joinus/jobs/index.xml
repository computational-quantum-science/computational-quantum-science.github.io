For investigations based on microscopic model systems one has to devise strategies to deal with the curse of dimensionality inherent to the quantum many-body problem. Particularly challenging is the development of efficient and versatile computational methods that serve as crucial link between experimental observations and theoretical models. For this purpose, we employ machine learning methods, which are for example well suited to represent the many-body wave function in a compressed form.
Our group is based at the University of Regensburg and furthermore affiliated with PGI-8 at Forschungszentrum JÃ¼lich.</description></item><item><title>Student assistant in machine learning for quantum science</title><link>https://www.computational-quantum.science/joinus/jobs/2024-shk/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 May 2024 18:28:07 +0200</pubDate><author>bWFya3VzLnNjaG1pdHRAZnotanVlbGljaC5kZQ== (Markus Schmitt)</author><guid>https://www.computational-quantum.science/joinus/jobs/2024-shk/</guid><description>We are currently lookging for a dedicated student assistant to support our research team.
