Within the Helmholtz Young Investigator Group “Machine Learning for Quantum Technology” we aspire to merge the parallel advancements of both fields, where quantum challenges match the natural strengths of machine learning and, reversely, the quantum applications call for the development of new machine learning techniques. Therefore, our research targets the exciting intersection of (non-equilibrium) quantum matter, quantum information, and machine learning with the goal of unveiling previously unexplored many-body physics and devising interactive strategies to manipulate artificial quantum systems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are looking for a motivated postdoc to join our team.

For investigations based on microscopic model systems one has to devise strategies to deal with the curse of dimensionality inherent to the quantum many-body problem. Particularly challenging is the development of efficient and versatile computational methods that serve as crucial link between experimental observations and theoretical models. For this purpose, we employ machine learning methods, which are for example well suited to represent the many-body wave function in a compressed form.&lt;/p>
