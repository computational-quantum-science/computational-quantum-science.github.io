The underlying idea of this approach is to tackle the quantum curse of dimensionality by exploiting the proven merit of artificial neural networks for dealing with high-dimensional data. This new numerically exact technique can overcome existing limitations of established computational methods. Thereby, it will open up intriguing physical regimes for numerical simulation, such as correlated electrons, which are confined to two spatial dimensions.
The goal of this project is investigate a disorder-driven insulator-superconductor transition. Generally, disorder in metals leads to a localization of the electronic wave function in the system and thus, to the transition from a conductor to an insulator. Similarly, it has been suggested that disorder in superconducting systems can drive the breakdown of the superconducting phase and the emergence of an insulating phase.</description></item></channel></rss>
