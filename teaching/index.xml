These technological advances have a strong impact also on the natural sciences — just recently, for example, the AlphaFold machine learning algorithm set new standards in the fundamentally difficult problem of protein folding. These developments have motivated researchers across all fields to explore machine learning techniques as an extension of their numerical toolbox.
In this seminar, we will concentrate mostly on applications of machine learning (ML) in condensed matter physics. This is a perfect match: The core functionality of ML — pattern recognition and dimensional reduction— might be precisely what is needed to cure the “curse of dimensionality”, i.</description></item></channel></rss>
