The DFG has decided to fund our Research Unit [FOR5919 "Machine Learning for Complex Quantum States"](https://for5919.github.io). This collaborative research initiative aims at developing machine-learning-enhanced techniques for simulation, data analysis, and control to enable new insights into complex quantum states and dynamics. It involves participants from eleven institutions across Germany and Switzerland. We're very excited to kick it off!
