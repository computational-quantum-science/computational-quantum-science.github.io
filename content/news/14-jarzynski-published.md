Jarzynski’s equality describes a relation in statistical physics between the fluctuations during a work process and the 
thermal free energy difference corresponding to the initial and final ensemble. While Jarzynski’s equality has been 
checked in many scenarios, previous experiments focused on systems with only a handful of degrees of freedom in the 
quantum regime. In our collaboration with colleagues at MPI PKS, the University of Bonn, and UC Berkeley/LBNL, we probed 
for the first time Jarzynski’s equality in the quantum many-body regime. We devise a dynamical protocol to measure work 
on quantum computers using a suitably prepared thermal ensemble and tested Jarzynski's equality on different quantum 
processors with up to 16 qubits.
