Periodic driving is a prime way to engineer quantum matter with interesting properties. For this purpose, it is essential to bring the system into metastable steady states, the properties of which governed by a corresponding effective Hamiltonian. We have developed a deep-learning-assisted variational algorithm to reconstruct such effective Hamiltonians from observations. Thereby, we could recover local Hamiltonians in pre-thermal regimes and observe the growing complexity of instantaneous effective Hamiltonians in subsequent heating regimes. Our findings are now published in [Phys. Rev. Research](https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.6.023160).
