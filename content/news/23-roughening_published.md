Thanks to great efforts by [Wladi](/people/wladi/), [our work on roughening dynamics](/publications/26_roughening/) now appeared in Physical Review Letters! In this paper, we describe how the smooth-interface regime below the roughening transition of the two-dimensional quantum Ising model leads to prethermal plateaux in the non-equilibrium dynamics of domain wall initial conditions.
