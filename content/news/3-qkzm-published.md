Our work on phase transition dynamics in the two-dimensional quantum Ising model appeared today in [Science Advances](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abl6850). [pro-physik.de](https://www.pro-physik.de/) has moreover published an [article about it for non-experts]((https://www.pro-physik.de/nachrichten/kibble-zurek-mechanismus-gilt-auch-fuer-quanten-phasenuebergaenge)).
