We developed a new approach to simulate spectral functions using neural quantum states, which for example accurately captures the gap closing at the phase transition of a two-dimensional quantum magnet despite the associated diverging time scale. The paper appeared today in [Phys. Rev. Lett.](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.131.046501)!
