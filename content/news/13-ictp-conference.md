Together with colleagues from Hamburg, Waterloo, and Augsburg, we are organizing a school and conference "Frontiers at the intersection of quantum simulation and machine learning" to be held from Apr 8 to 19 2024 at the [International Centre for Theoretical Physics](https://www.ictp.it/) (ICTP) in Trieste. This will be the first event at ICTP co-sponsored by the [WE Heraeus Foundation](https://www.we-heraeus-stiftung.de/english/). More detailed information will follow soon on the [event website](https://indico.ictp.it/event/10466).
