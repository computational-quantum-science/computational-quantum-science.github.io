Today, we are launching our Helmholtz Young Investigator Group "Machine Learning for Quantum Technology" at PGI-8 (FZ JÃ¼lich). Within this project we are going to develop machine learning techniques for the advancement of quantum technologies with a focus on two promising applications: On the one hand, we will employ [neural quantum states](research/neural_quantum_states) for simulations of non-equilibrium quantum matter, and, on the other hand, we will develop a versatile framework for [optimal quantum control based on reinforcement learning](research/reinforcement_learning).
