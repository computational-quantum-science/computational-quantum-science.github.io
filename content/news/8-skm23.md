For ML+Quantum Physics enthusiasts and all those who would like to learn about it, we are organizing a Tutorial Session ["Physics Meets Machine Learning"](https://www.dpg-verhandlungen.de/year/2023/conference/skm/part/tut/session/1) and a Focus Session ["Machine Learning for Complex Quantum Systems"](https://www.dpg-verhandlungen.de/year/2023/conference/skm/part/dy/session/2) at the DPG Spring Meeting in Dresden. There will also be another Focus Session on ["Understanding Machine Learning as Complex Interacting Systems"](https://www.dpg-verhandlungen.de/year/2023/conference/skm/part/dy/session/11). All these sessions promise to be very interesting with great invited speakers -- so come by!
