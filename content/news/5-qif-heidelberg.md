During the next two days [Markus](/people/markus/) will mentor a team of talented students and young researchers, who will tackle the quantum control problem with reinforcement learning approaches at the scientific hackathon of the [Quantum Ideas Factory 2022](http://www.efeqt.eu/index.php/quantum-ideas-factory/) in Heidelberg. Thanks to [Mo](/people/mo/) for the help to set up the challenge. That's going to be fun!
