During the next two days [Markus](/people/markus) will mentor a team of talented students and young researchers, who will tackle the quantum control problem with reinforcement learning approaches at the scientific hackathon of the [Quantum Ideas Factory 2022](http://efeqt.eu/index.php/quantum-ideas-factory/) in Heidelberg. That's going to be fun!
