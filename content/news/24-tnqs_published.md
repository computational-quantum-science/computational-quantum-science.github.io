Our [article on explicitly time-dependent NQS](publications/27_tnqs) has been published in *Machine Learning: Science and Technology*. Instead of conventional forward-integration of Schr√∂dinger's equation, this technique optimizes an artificial neural network to solve the dynamics simultaneoulsy across a whole time interval. We demonstrated the efficiency of the approach by simulating quench dynamics and a time-dependent control protocol for a large two-dimensional quantum magnet.
