The advent of quantum simulators and computers has made projective measurement a reality at the many-particle level: Experiments routinely collect high-quality pictures of wave functions made of hundreds of components. But the wealth of information obtained challenges traditional theoretical modeling, which often focuses on a few observables. In our work, that is now [published in Phys. Rev. X](https://journals.aps.org/prx/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevX.14.021029), we introduce a framework to describe wave-function measurements using network theory, enabling the discovery of a very deep inner structure in quantum wave functions: scale-freeness similar to other completely disconnected ensembles, such as those found in communication, social networks and the internet.
