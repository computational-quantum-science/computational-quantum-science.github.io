Our research is directed at understanding and controlling the collective dynamics of quantum many-body systems far from equilibrium, which may ultimately pave the way to devise new technologies that rely on the quantum laws of nature. However, addressing them theoretically is a demanding task: For investigations based on microscopic model systems one has to devise strategies to deal with the curse of dimensionality inherent to the quantum many-body problem. Particularly challenging is the development of efficient and versatile computational methods that serve as crucial link between experimental observations and theoretical models. An alternative route is to use a quantum computer for the simulation, which – in turn – means to realize a highly controlled quantum-dynamical process.
