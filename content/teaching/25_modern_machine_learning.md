The lecture and lab "Modern Machine Learning" delve deeper into the modern methods of machine learning (ML). In particular, methods of deep learning and reinforcement learning are covered. Topics include the theoretical foundations of deep learning and reinforcement learning, architectures of artificial neural networks, generative modelling, deep reinforcement learning, automatic differentiation and relevant optimization methods. Possible fields of application are discussed, e.g. the processing of images or natural language, anomaly detection or optimal control. For the practical implementation of the concepts, an introduction to JAX will be part of the course.
