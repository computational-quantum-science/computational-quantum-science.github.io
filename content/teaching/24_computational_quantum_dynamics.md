Modern experiments employing ultrafast pump-probe techniques or quantum simulation are opening up the exciting realm of far-from-equilibrium quantum dynamics. These developments have directed theoretical attention to questions about thermalization, non-equilibrium phases of matter, and transient dynamical phenomena. Since analytical approaches are typically limited, numerical methods are key to understand the theoretical models. This lecture will cover a variety of computational tools for the simulation of quantum dynamics, namely:

1. Time-dependent single-particle Schr√∂dinger equation
   * Spectral methods
   * PDE integration
2. Non-interacting many-body systems
   * Free fermions
   * Bogoliubov transformation
3. Interacting many-body systems
   * Exact diagonalization
   * Semiclassical approaches
   * Tensor network methods
   * Neural quantum states

Throughout the course, we will implement these methods in exercises and interactive sessions. The resulting codes will be used to investigate a variety of quantum dynamical phenomena, such as

* Quantum chaos
* Non-equilibrium dynamics
* Thermalization
* Dynamical phase transitions
* Information spreading
