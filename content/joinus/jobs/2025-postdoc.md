The development of quantum technologies and machine learning are two of the most dynamic research directions of our time. Within the Helmholtz Young Investigator Group “Machine Learning for Quantum Technology” we aspire to merge the parallel advancements of both fields, where quantum challenges match the natural strengths of machine learning and, reversely, the quantum applications call for the development of new machine learning techniques. Therefore, our research targets the exciting intersection of (non-equilibrium) quantum matter, quantum information, and machine learning with the goal of unveiling previously unexplored many-body physics and devising interactive strategies to manipulate artificial quantum systems.

We are looking for a motivated postdoc to join our team. [See the opening for further details](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/careers/jobs/2025-106).
