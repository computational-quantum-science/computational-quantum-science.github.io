The research of our "Computational quantum science" research group is directed at understanding and controlling the collective dynamics of quantum many-body systems far from equilibrium, which may ultimately pave the way to devise new technologies that rely on the quantum laws of nature. For investigations based on microscopic model systems one has to devise strategies to deal with the curse of dimensionality inherent to the quantum many-body problem. Particularly challenging is the development of efficient and versatile computational methods that serve as crucial link between experimental observations and theoretical models. For this purpose, we employ machine learning methods, which are for example well suited to represent the many-body wave function in a compressed form.

Our group is based at the [University of Regensburg](https://www.uni-regensburg.de/en) and furthermore affiliated with [PGI-8 at Forschungszentrum Jülich](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/pgi/pgi-8).

### Your job

A central objective of our work is the advancement of numerical simulation techniques based on [neural quantum states](/research/neural_quantum_states/). The underlying idea of this approach is to tackle the quantum curse of dimensionality by exploiting the proven merit of artificial neural networks for dealing with high-dimensional data. This new numerically exact technique can overcome existing limitations of established computational methods. Thereby, it opens up new areas for numerical investigations, which are at the same time brought into focus by recent developments in quantum simulation – for example with Rydberg atom arrays. Your tasks in detail will be:

- Method development to advance neural quantum states for periodically driven systems
- Simulation of non-equilibrium dynamics with connection to quantum simulation experiments
- Participation in international conferences in Germany and abroad (incl. presenting
your research results)
- Preparing scientific publications and project reports
- Early-on co-tutoring of younger students

### Your Profile

- Masters degree in Physics, ideally with a specialization in quantum many-body physics
- Coursework and experience in (a subset of) quantum mechanics, condensed matter physics, computational physics, statistical physics, non-equilibrium quantum many-body physics
- Methodological competence: Strong programming skills, ideally including experience in deep learning and/or high performance computing
- Very good English communication skills – both verbal and written
- High degree of independence and commitment
- Very reliable and conscientious style of working
- Excellent ability to cooperate and work in a team

### Our Offer

We work on the very latest issues at the interface of two of the most exciting technological developments of our time - machine learning and quantum technology - and are offering you the chance to actively participate! We offer ideal conditions for you to complete your doctoral degree:
- A highly motivated working group as well as an international and interdisciplinary
working environment
- A research project in cooperation with colleagues at the [Max Planck Institute for Physics of Complex Systems](https://pks.mpg.de)
- Outstanding scientific and technical infrastructure
- Opportunity to participate in (international) conferences, schools, and workshops
- Continuous scientific mentoring by your scientific advisors
- A workplace right next to a UNESCO world heritage site: the beautiful and livable town of [Regensburg](https://www.regensburg.de/worldheritage).
