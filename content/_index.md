Welcome to the pages of our Computational Quantum Science research group! [Our research](research/) covers various aspects of complex quantum systems, especially non-equilibrium settings. We have a strong focus on the development of computational methods that leverage the latest developments in machine learning for this purpose. Our group is part of [PGI-8 at FZ JÃ¼lich](https://www.fz-juelich.de/de/pgi/pgi-8).
