Hello! I am Sven. This is how ChatGPT describes me:<br>
I’m currently focused on developing efficient numerical techniques to simulate and analyze quantum many-body systems, especially where frustration, tensor-network structure, and quantum-information “resources” (like entanglement/coherence/magic) matter. My day-to-day work mixes theory with implementation: building and debugging workflows in Python/JAX and Julia, working with tensor networks (MPS/TTN/TCI-style decompositions) and neural-network quantum states, and caring a lot about reproducibility, performance, and clean computational pipelines (often on HPC). I tend to prefer concrete, step-by-step explanations that connect the physics intuition directly to arrays, operators, and code that I can run and verify.
