Hi, I’m Noe!

I'm currently focused on developing efficient numerical techniques to simulate and study Floquet systems. My work involves leveraging machine learning methods, particularly neural network quantum states, together with theoretical insights to improve these simulations. More broadly, I’m interested in numerical approaches for studying complex systems in quantum physics.
