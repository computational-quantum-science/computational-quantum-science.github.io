Hi, I’m Jonas and currently I am a Postdoc in the  Computational Quantum Science Research Group. I am interested in quantum many-body physics, ranging from condensed matter systems to quantum simulators. In my research I investigate modern machine learning methods that can potentially provide unprecedented insights into quantum many-body systems. In my free time I enjoy yoga, books and all possible ways to get up and down a mountain.
