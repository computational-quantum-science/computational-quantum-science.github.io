Hello!! I'm Moksh, a master's student with academic interests in theoretical and computational condensed matter physics, the dynamics of quantum many-body systems, and machine learning. Currently, I am researching the evolution and dynamics of quantum systems, focusing on the spatial and temporal behavior of entanglement in many-body systems through an information theory framework. Recreationally, I enjoy watching movies, listening to music, traveling, swimming, and drawing portraits.
