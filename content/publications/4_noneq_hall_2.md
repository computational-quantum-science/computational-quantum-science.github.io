We study the Hall conductance in a Floquet topological insulator in the long time limit after sudden switches of the driving amplitude. Based on a high frequency expansion of the effective Hamiltonian and the micromotion operator we demonstrate that the Hall conductance as function of the driving amplitude follows universal non-analytic laws close to phase transitions that are related to conic gap closing points, namely a logarithmic divergence for gapped initial states and jumps of a definite height for gapless initial states. This constitutes a generalization of the results known for the static systems to the driven case.
