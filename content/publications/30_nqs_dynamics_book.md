While experimental advancements continue to expand the capabilities to control and probe non-equilibrium quantum matter at an unprecedented level, the numerical simulation of the dynamics of correlated quantum systems remains a pivotal challenge - especially in intermediate spatial dimensions. Neural quantum states are emerging as a new computational tool to investigate the time evolution of many-body quantum systems in previously inaccessible regimes. We review the recent progress in the field with a focus on the different time propagation methods, an overview of the reported applications, and a discussion of the major current challenges.
