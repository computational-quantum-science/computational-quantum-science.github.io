The properties of interfaces are key to understand the physics of matter. However, the study of quantum interface dynamics has remained an outstanding challenge. Here, we use large-scale Tree Tensor Network simulations to identify the dynamical signature of an interface roughening transition within the ferromagnetic phase of the 2D quantum Ising model. For initial domain wall profiles we find extended prethermal plateaus for smooth interfaces, whereas above the roughening transition the domain wall decays quickly. Our results can be readily explored experimentally in Rydberg atomic systems.
