Within this project we are going to develop machine learning techniques for the advancement of quantum technologies with a focus on two promising applications: On the one hand, we will employ neural quantum states for simulations of non-equilibrium quantum matter, and, on the other hand, we will develop a versatile framework for optimal quantum control based on reinforcement learning.</description></item></channel></rss>
