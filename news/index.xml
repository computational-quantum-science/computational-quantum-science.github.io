For this purpose, it is essential to bring the system into metastable steady states, the properties of which governed by a corresponding effective Hamiltonian. We have developed a deep-learning-assisted variational algorithm to reconstruct such effective Hamiltonians from observations. Thereby, we could recover local Hamiltonians in pre-thermal regimes and observe the growing complexity of instantaneous effective Hamiltonians in subsequent heating regimes.

thermal free energy difference corresponding to the initial and final ensemble. While Jarzynski’s equality has been
checked in many scenarios, previous experiments focused on systems with only a handful of degrees of freedom in the
quantum regime. In our collaboration with colleagues at MPI PKS, the University of Bonn, and UC Berkeley/LBNL, we probed
for the first time Jarzynski’s equality in the quantum many-body regime. We devise a dynamical protocol to measure work
on quantum computers using a suitably prepared thermal ensemble and tested Jarzynski&amp;rsquo;s equality on different quantum
processors with up to 16 qubits.
